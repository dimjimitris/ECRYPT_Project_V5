As required by the project description our program was tested and works in `Python 3.10` environments.

Required packages can be installed with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use this implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run `test.py` to observe the results of some testing we did on our algorithms
4. Run `tests_with_output.py` to see some simple messages and the outputs of our algorithm.
5. `rabin_signature.py` contains the functions used for key generation, signing and verifying. By running this file you can use a simple program which utilizes our functions with a fixed seed so that results are reproducible. You input a text message and a signature is produced and verified for it.

## Rabin Signature API

The `rabin_signature.py` module provides the following functions for key generation, signing, and verifying:

- `key_generation(bits)`: Generates a public-private key pair for Rabin digital signature, the primes used are of length `bits`.
- `sign(message, private_key, k)`: Signs a message using the private key and returns the signature. `k` is a parameter used for specifying the length of a random string appended at the end of the message.
- `verify(message, signature, public_key)`: Verifies the signature of a message using the public key.

To use these functions, import the `rabin_signature` module and call the respective functions.

## Algorithm Explanation

The `hash function` and parameter `k` (controls size of random string appended to message) are public (known to everyone).

Prime numbers we use as private key: if `p` is such a prime then we select `p mod 4 = 3` or `4 | (p + 1)`.

These primes come in handy, because the Rabin algorithm looks for quadratic residues modulo a prime. And we know that:
if there exists `x` such that `x^2 mod p = c` then one such `x` is `x = c^((p + 1) / 4) mod p` if `p mod 4 = 3` (A).

- Key generation: key generation function is nothing special. We produce 2 primes that leave remainder 3 when divided by 4. These primes are the private key and their product is the public key.
- Signing:
    1. produce random string `u` of length `k` bits
    2. append `u` at the end of message `message`
    3. calculate the hash value of this string, let's call it `c`
    4. Check if `c` is a q.r. modulo `n`, where `n` is the public key. To do this we can, equivalently, check if `c` is a q.r. `mod p` and `mod q` where `p`, `q` are the private key. We do this by evaluating the Jacobi Symbol. If c is not a q.r. modulo `n` then we go back to step (1.), otherwise, we continue. (It will take about 4 tries to satisfy this criterion)
    5. Find `x` such that `x^2 mod n = c`.
        1. First we find `x_p`, `x_q` such that `x_p^2 mod p = c` and `x_q^2 mod q = c` (using formula (A))
        2. We are looking for `a`, `b` such that `a = 1 mod p`, `a = 0 mod q`, `b = 0 mod p`, `b = 1 mod q`. Then `x = a * x_p + b * x_q` will be a solution to our original problem.
        3. How do we find them?
            1. Solve CRT for: `x = x_p mod p` and `x = x_q mod q`.
            2. The solution gives us: `y_p` and `y_q` such that `p * y_p + q * y_q = 1` (Extended GCD algorithm), so `y_p = p^(-1) mod q` and `y_q = q^(-1) mod p`.
            3. `x = (q * y_q) * x_p + (p * y_p) * x_q`
            4. Test if `a = q * y_q` and `b = p * y_p` satisfy the previous conditions. We can easily observe that they do.
        4. Thus, the solution is `x = (q * y_q) * x_p + (p * y_p) * x_q mod n`
    6. We return the signature `(x, u)`
- Verification: Verification isn't anything special. We compute `x^2` and `c = hash of (message + u)` and compare the two modulo `n`, where `n` is the public key.

The safety of this signature system lies with the fact that solving `x^2 = c mod n` when the factorization of `n` is not known is equivalent to integer factorization of `n` which is a hard problem.

## Libraries
We make use of `sympy` and `hashlib`. `hashlib` is simply used to get a hash function for our messages (which is another project topic thus was not implemented specifically for this project) and `sympy` is used to generate random prime numbers in the key generation part of our algorithm. There are many ways to implement such a generator and some of them have varying complexity, which seems outside the scope of this project. We make use of `sympy`â€™s `igcd()` function which calculates the gcd of two integers, but we  have already demonstrated the gcd algorithm in the `_extended_gcd()` function, thus did not reimplement it. We focus only on the Rabin Digital Signature Scheme.

## Testing
The Rabin Digital Signature Scheme depends on the random string `u` appended to the `message` and the hash function used. I could not find any test vectors for this thus testing happens in the following way: a key is generated -> message is signed using the key -> message is verified.

Our algorithm can be tested as follows:
- `test.py` file contains a lot of messages (more than 7). We generate a private and public key and test all messages using these keys. We repeat this process 10 times (`test_sign_and_verify()`).
- `tests_with_output.py` tests some messages and output the keys, signatures and verification results in the console.
- `rabin_signature.py` when executed simply takes a message as input from the console. Then creates a private/public key, sings the message and verifies. All this behaviour is tracked on the console output.
